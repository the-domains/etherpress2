ConsenSys released [a white paper about FarmShare][0], a decentralized CSA platform

Agriculture is one of the few industries, which are not affected 
significantly by the information technology proliferation. 
Community-supported agriculture (CSA) is an alternative economic model 
for the distribution and production of locally grown produce, as it 
promotes a new form of collaborative labor ownership, local oriented 
economics and communal land ownership that relies on the direct 
engagement of farmer and consumer. Today, CSA has grown in various sizes
and numbers and many organizations started using in their marketing 
strategy.

In ConsenSys' Farmshare white paper, you get to know the potential of
a community supported agriculture evolution model that takes benefits 
of a blockchain potential for a token-based equity shares, automated 
governance and distributed consensus to foster better community 
engagement while removing few financial risks and managerial burdens 
from the farmers who involve in CSA. Basically, Farmshare allows new 
property forms, community operation, self sufficient economies and 
community operation to facilitate collaboration between the shareholders
and farmers, which has proved tough for CSA organization depending on 
the traditional model of communication and planning.

Ethereum based Farmshare tokens are the currency of this CSA model 
and help to buy the crops provided by the CSA. Farmers can use an 
estimate of their crops they produce before the token sale and 
shareholders can purchase the shares to personalize their weekly 
deliveries through exchanging certain CSA products shares. Exchanges 
offer the necessary flexibility for shareholders to exit and enter into 
the Farmshare community mid-harvest, which is the peer-to-peer network, 
so its value is directly related to the active users counts. It also 
incorporates the loT technology in form of soil quality sensors, 
automated irrigation systems, and weather monitoring devices offering 
the feedback mechanism for the community members as well as farmers to 
make excellent decisions about crop production and land management.

Farmshare relies on radical models of the economics and community 
organization, hence demanding an intuitive user interface to make more 
abstract concepts easy to understand and tangible. As the 
proof-of-concept, Farmshare starts with the small aquaponic systems with
the built in sensor as well as automation to make caring for fish and 
plants easy.

[FarmShare will be at Callicoon Art Walk][1] tomorrow, Saturday Oct 10th, from 12--8pm the Weigh Station and Silos, 12 Main St, Callicoon, NY 12723
